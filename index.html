            <h2>2. What is Space and Time Efficiency? Why Are They Important?</h2>
            <h3>Algorithm Efficiency and Complexity</h3>
            <p><strong>Time Efficiency:</strong> Measures the computational time required to execute an algorithm and represents the number of basic operations performed by an algorithm.</p>
            <p><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong> Measures the memory (storage) required by an algorithm, tracking how much memory is consumed by the input size and determining how much additional memory is needed to solve a problem.</p>

            <h4>Key Principles:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>A good algorithm executes quickly and saves space in the process.</li>
                <li>We should find a balance between space and time efficiency (space and time complexity).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the world of computer science, to perform better, we need to write algorithms that are time-efficient and use less memory. Algorithms should be resource-optimized, solving larger problems with limited computing power, and improving user experience and system performance.</p>

            <h4>Different Classes of Problems and Orders of Growth:</h4>
            <p>Orders of growth help us understand the performance of algorithms as input size increases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Constant Time (O(1)):</strong> Performance is independent of input size.</li>
                <li><strong>Logarithmic Time (O(log n)):</strong> Performance grows logarithmically with input size.</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Time (O(n)):</strong> Performance grows proportionally with input size.</li>
                <li><strong>Quadratic Time (O(n^2)):</strong> Performance grows with the square of the input size.</li>
                <li><strong>Exponential Time (O(2^n)):</strong> Performance doubles with each addition to the input size.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Takeaway from Different Design Principles from Chapter 2</h2>

            <p><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces to simplify and solve them effectively.</p>

            <p><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identify recurring patterns in problems to generalize solutions and make predictions.</p>

            <p><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Focus on essential features and ignore unnecessary details to simplify problem-solving.</p>

            <p><strong>Brave vs. Cautious Traversal:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DFS (Brave):</strong> Explore deeply before backtracking.</li>
                    <li><strong>BFS (Cautious):</strong> Explore level by level.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>


  <p><strong>Pruning:</strong> Skip unnecessary paths to save time and resources (e.g., N-Queenâ€™s problem).</p>

            <p><strong>Lazy Propagation:</strong> Delay updates in data structures like segment trees for efficiency, especially with large datasets.</p>

            <p><strong>Sliding Window:</strong> Efficiently analyze overlapping sub-arrays, useful for tasks like finding maximum sums.</p>

            <p><strong>Level Order Traversal:</strong> Explore tree nodes level by level (similar to BFS).</p>

            <p><strong>Hierarchical Data:</strong> Use parent-child relationships (e.g., family trees) to organize and manage information.</p>

            <p><strong>Edge Relaxation:</strong> Update shortest paths in algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s by rechecking neighboring paths.</p>

            <p><strong>Balancing and Rotations:</strong> Prevent unbalanced trees in AVL and Red-Black trees to maintain efficient operations.</p>

            <p><strong>Kleene Closure:</strong> Find relationships in graphs and determine all possible connections (transitive closure).</p>

            <p><strong>Pre-Computing:</strong> Calculate and store frequently needed results in advance to save runtime (e.g., lookup tables).</p>

            <p><strong>Parental Dominance:</strong> Maintain efficiency in heaps by ensuring the root is the largest or smallest element.</p>

            <p><strong>Prefix and Suffix:</strong> Key for pattern matching and string operations in tasks like searching and bioinformatics.</p>

            <p><strong>Partitioning:</strong> Divide problems into smaller parts for recursion, widely used in sorting and searching.</p>

            <p><strong>Bit Manipulations:</strong> Use operations like AND, OR, XOR for memory-efficient algorithms (e.g., Fenwick trees).</p>

            <p><strong>Memoization:</strong> Store previous results in recursive algorithms to avoid redundant calculations.</p>

            <p><strong>Invariants:</strong> Conditions that stay constant during execution, ensuring correctness (e.g., maintaining sorted order).</p>

            <p><strong>Shortest Path Trees:</strong> Show shortest routes from a starting node, useful for navigation and network optimization.</p>

            <p><strong>Principles of Array Query Algorithms</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Divide and Conquer:</strong> Breaking queries into smaller subproblems for efficient computation.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming:</strong> Storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.</li>
                <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Balancing preprocessing time with query time to achieve overall efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Array Query Algorithms: Overview</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Core Purpose:</strong> Array query algorithms are designed to efficiently retrieve, manipulate, or analyze information within large datasets, addressing challenges of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast information retrieval</li>
                <li>Complex data processing</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Principle:</strong> Divide and conquer strategy</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> O(log n)</li>

            <h4>6. Trees and graphs and their traversals</h4>
            <p><strong>Differentiating Trees and Graphs:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tree:</strong> A simple structure with one main "root" and branches that donâ€™t loop back (no cycles). It is like a family tree where each person has only one parent (except for the root). Example: A folder structure on your computer.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph:</strong> A graph is more complex. It can have cycles (loops) and no specific structure. Nodes (points) can be connected in many different ways, not necessarily hierarchically. Example: A map of cities connected by roads, where you can travel in multiple directions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tree Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a tree):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In-Order:</strong> Visit left side, then the node, then right side. Used for: Sorting data in binary search trees.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Order:</strong> Visit the node first, then the left side, and then the right side. Used for: Making a copy of the tree.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Order:</strong> Visit the left side first, then the right side, and finally the node. Used for: Deleting nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Level-Order (BFS):</strong> Visit nodes level by level from the root. Used for: Finding the shortest path in simple trees.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Graph Traversals (Ways to visit nodes in a graph):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DFS (Depth-First Search):</strong> Start at one node, go as deep as possible, and backtrack when needed. Used for: Solving mazes, finding connected components.</li>
                <li><strong>BFS (Breadth-First Search):</strong> Visit neighbors first, then their neighbors, and so on. Used for: Finding the shortest path in simple graphs, like finding the shortest route on a map.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tree Applications:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>File System: Organizing folders and files.</li>
                    <li>Binary Search Tree (BST): Efficiently finding data in databases.</li>
                    <li>Decision Trees: Used in making decisions, like in machine learning.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Graph Applications:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Social Networks: Connections between people (friends, followers).</li>
                    <li>Maps/Navigation: Finding the shortest route between cities or locations.</li>
                    <li>Web Crawlers: Searching the internet by following links between websites.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
